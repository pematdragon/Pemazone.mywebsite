    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Pema Tshering. Ever since I was young, I have been deeply curious about the world around me. I love learning new things, exploring martial arts, painting, and discovering unique experiences that help me grow. Martial arts has taught me discipline, patience, and the importance of hard work. I enjoy training regularly, improving my techniques, and watching professional fighters to learn from their dedication and mindset.Aside from martial arts, painting has always been a creative outlet for me. I love experimenting with colors, creating landscapes, and bringing my imagination to life on canvas. Art allows me to express myself in ways words cannot, and it’s a hobby I dedicate time to every week. Nature and animals are also a big part of my life. As a child, I would spend entire days watching wildlife documentaries and learning about different species. This passion has stayed with me, and I often find myself exploring outdoors, photographing animals, and learning more about ecosystems.

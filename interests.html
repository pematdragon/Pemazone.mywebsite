        <h3>Muay Thai & Boxing</h3>
      </label>
      <p class="interest-text">
        Muay Thai and Boxing have been central to my personal growth and discipline. These martial arts teach me not only how to defend myself, but also how to stay focused under pressure, push beyond physical limits, and cultivate mental strength. Each training session is an opportunity to challenge myself, whether I am perfecting a kick, improving my speed, or learning new techniques from experienced fighters. Watching professional matches inspires me and gives me insight into strategy, patience, and perseverance. Over time, martial arts has become more than a hobby; it’s a lifestyle that shapes my approach to challenges in everyday life.
